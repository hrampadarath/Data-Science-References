## Challenge

Your product manager wants to understand if the new client has increased the number of
people joining hubs. They therefore asked you whether you could test if the following hypothesis true:

H0: The **proportion** of users who used the new client and joined at least one hub is larger than
the proportion of users who are using the old web client and joined at least one hub.

Conduct a test of hypothesis, and state any assumptions you have made. What would your
feedback be to the product team?


## Data Set

```{r}
df <- read_excel("../client__1_.xlsx")
head(df)
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```





```{r}
table(df$client)/nrow(df)
```



```{r}
table(df$client, df$joined_at_least_1_hub)/sum(df$joined_at_least_1_hub,na.rm=TRUE)
```



```{r}
df$joined_at_least_1_hub[is.na(df$joined_at_least_1_hub)] <- 0
```



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df %>% ggplot(aes(y=lifespan)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~joined_at_least_1_hub, scale="free")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df %>% ggplot(aes(y=lifespan)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~client, scale="free")
```
